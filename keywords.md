## feedback

postcard as the intermedia has its own features and that’s why people still use it as a method to communicate with others.

what paper brings to us?

what people will do after receiving postcards?

Is their special way to keep the postcards in a more meaningful way?

What time would do for the postcards?

What “time” means here and what role it is playing in the process?

What’s the difference with the exsiting postcard?

Is there any special point you want to develop further in your project?

There are many ways to slow down why you chose postcards as the form?

postcard the intention can really resonate with me because fast-pace modern life is eliminating many things. How can you make people use this installation?

what  feeling?
What media can postcard transform? Paper print? printmaking? digital vers?
AR/VR? what do we lost in this process of transmedia?
How time plays a role in the whole process?

“Grandma’s mailbox”

I love the form of letter/postcard! It would be interesting to think about “unusual” forms of postcard, does it have to be paper made? A postcard tells a lot story about its journey! 
As well as the story between the sender and the receiver. I also enjoy the uncertainty that kodak brings, which is just like having random surprises in our daily life. There’s also uncertainty about when are you receiving it.

intergrate AR in postcard (Maybe)

what’s user>>postcard interaction?
what you want to bring to both the receivers and senders?

Thinking about sending postcard, I think more could be done by checking the “stations” where you can send them.

-who are the characters still using postcards today?
for what purpose?
where & how are they sending?
what kind of things they write on postcards?

Try think about something has the function of postcard but not postcard
