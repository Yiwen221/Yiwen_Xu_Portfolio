## DAY 1: Privacy Alert!!
"The consequences of every act are included in the act itself."
                                 -- George Orwell, *1984*
"Google knows what you're looking for. Facebook knows what you like. Sharing is the norm, and secrecy is out. But what is the psychological and cultural fallout from the end of privacy?"
                                 -- The Guardian
