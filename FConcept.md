## concept 1

who: young people who are curious about other’s privacy

what: “When you are spying on others, others are also spying on you.”
Most people said they often read about others’ personal lives at social platforms (almost every day, it gradually becomes an entertainment during leisure time), but most of them only occasionally post something about their lives and said they don’t want other people know too much about them.

why: Make them think: How do you like the feeling of peeping at others or being peeped?

how: an installation like the concept “private box” 

## concept 2

who: people like sending postcards

what: In the past, writing letters and sending postcards are used to be very important for people to bond with each other.

why: There’s still something valuable and irreplaceable about postcards, since the connection they brought has more memorable meaning. Also, I want to find a way to balance the digital & paper form.

how: a product aimed to give people a chance to connected with each other in a more commemorative way. It’s basically an interaction screen that places on the bus station so it can be easily found. Using the screen, people can send postcards in paper or digital form.

## concept 3

who: people often go to the library

what&why: Scenario 1: Things that require long-term accumulation such as reading and memorizing words cannot give people an intuitive sense of accomplishment and feedback in a short period of time. It makes people feel that there is no difference between one more time and one less time, which makes it difficult to persist.

Scenario 2: When the important exams come, the number of people going to study and read books increases. One of the reasons is that intuitive scores are the result that people pay more attention to. The second reason is the influence of group effect.

Scenario 3: People who often read books will have troubles: Taking notes halfway will affect the reading experience. After reading, too many feelings are often too late to record. After a period of time, the content of this book is generally forgotten. Open again as if "second first time"

how: develop the library card. add function: record books/routine/audio notes. Record>>Data visualization.

## concept 4

who: people that interested in M.C.Escher and his inescapably mathematical art

what&why: What I started thinking about was to show the inseparable relationship between art and logic. It is also what many people are paying attention to: the combination of sensibility and rationality. Logic and rationality can also have a different kind of beauty, sense of art. 

how: a VR exhibition with the 3D model of Escher’s art work

## concept 5

who: students interested in/have trouble learning geometry

what&why: Chinese students are under great pressure (especially those in middle&high school), since our form of education is test-driven. Math is a subject that troubles students a lot. 

how: an AR/VR glasses helps them manipulate 3D graphs with their fingers. for example: control a coordinate system with your fingers(move it/scale/add points/add lines/...)
